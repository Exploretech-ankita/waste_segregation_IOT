# waste_segregation_IOT
This is the IoT component of our Smart Waste Segregation project.
We used an Arduino microcontroller to interface with and control all hardware components, including sensors, servos, and input modules. 
You can find the full project here: https://github.com/rudranil5/Smart-waste-Segregation
The hardware components we have used hare are 
1.Three servo motors 
2.4 IR sensors
3.moisture sensor
4.Gas sensor
5.Ultrasonic sensor .
